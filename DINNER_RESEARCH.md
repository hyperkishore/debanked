## 1. TOP 5 DINNER CONVERSATION TOPICS

### TOPIC 1: The Yellowstone Capital Fallout and What It Means for MCA's Future
**Why it will dominate the table:** In January 2025, the NY Attorney General secured a $1.065 billion judgment against Yellowstone Capital for predatory loans disguised as MCAs — the largest consumer protection settlement in state history. Over $534M in outstanding balances were canceled, 1,100+ judgments discharged, and Yellowstone was barred from the MCA industry permanently.

**Why everyone cares:**
- **Adam Madar** (Aspire Funding) is a former Yellowstone Capital Funding Advisor. This is deeply personal — he will have insider perspective on what went wrong, and how Aspire is distancing itself from that legacy.
- **Jay Avigdor, Nabil Aziz, Herk Christie, Gerard Lucero** — All MCA funders who now face heightened regulatory scrutiny because of Yellowstone. Their underwriting and collection practices are being examined through a post-Yellowstone lens.
- **David Tilis** — Built fintech partnerships at Cross River and FinWise, both of which are bank partners to MCA funders. He understands the compliance infrastructure needed to survive.

**Conversation starter:** "With Yellowstone's billion-dollar judgment, are we going to see a wave of AG investigations into other funders, or was Yellowstone a one-off?"

**Key context:**
- NY FAIR Business Practices Act now allows AG to scrutinize MCA collection tactics under consumer-level standards
- Roughly a dozen states now have dedicated MCA regulation on the books
- California SB 1235 and NY CFDL mandate detailed pre-funding APR-equivalent disclosures
- Texas HB 700 (introduced April 2025) would regulate auto-debiting from business accounts
- Federal judge upheld CFPB's small business lending data collection rule, affirming MCAs should be regulated as credit transactions

---

### TOPIC 2: AI Underwriting — Hype vs. Reality (93% Accuracy Claims, Agentic AI, and Regulatory Backlash)
**Why it will spark debate:** Multiple people at the table are building or buying AI underwriting — but the regulatory walls are closing in fast.

**The players at this table:**
- **Jay Avigdor** (Velocity Capital) claims 93% default prediction accuracy using AI that analyzes demographics, deposit patterns, and transactional history
- **Aakanksha Jadhav** (Mastercard) leads GenAI credit risk models for SMEs at Mastercard Foundry — she is building the next generation of AI credit models
- **Aman Mahajan** (Biz2Credit) — Biz2X launched an AI Underwriting Agent that claims 30-40% reduction in loan approval time and 40-50% improvement in credit assessment. They partnered with Columbia University on AI for SMB lending
- **Kaustubh Joshi** (iBusiness Funding) — LenderAI processes 1,200+ loan applications daily with AI-driven origination
- **Rohan Sriram** (Plaid) — LendScore uses cash-flow insights and network data from 150M+ linked accounts to predict default likelihood

**The regulatory threat:**
- Massachusetts AG settled a fair lending action in July 2025 against a lender whose AI underwriting model created disparate impact based on race and immigration status
- Colorado SB 24-205 (effective Feb 1, 2026 — literally just activated) requires lenders to disclose how AI-driven lending decisions are made, including data sources and model performance
- EU AI Act high-risk provisions for credit scoring take effect August 2026
- CFPB requires specific adverse action reasons — "the AI said no" is not legally sufficient

**Conversation starter:** "Jay, you've claimed 93% accuracy on default prediction with AI. Aakanksha, you're building GenAI models at Mastercard. With Massachusetts just settling a disparate impact case against AI underwriting — how do you prove your models don't discriminate?"

---

### TOPIC 3: The MCA Stacking Problem and Document Fraud Epidemic
**Why it matters to every funder at the table:** Business identity theft is up 30% year-over-year (FTC 2024). Fraudsters can buy bank statement templates for $10 and customize them with generative AI to create entirely synthetic financial documents that bypass traditional document checks.

**The stacking problem:** Businesses take multiple MCAs simultaneously ("stacking"), hiding existing positions from new funders. This is the single biggest loss driver for MCA funders, and nobody has a great solution.

**Who cares most:**
- **Brian Mullins** (Vox Funding) — Built SYNQ API specifically to streamline deal submission and approvals; fraud detection in incoming applications is a core challenge
- **Nabil Aziz** (Smarter Merchant) — Head of Risk, his entire job is catching fraudulent applications
- **Adam Madar** (Aspire Funding) — Underwriting head must distinguish real from fake bank statements daily
- **Gerard Lucero** (Fundfi) — Revenue-based financing depends on accurate revenue verification
- **Rohan Sriram** (Plaid) — Plaid invested heavily in anti-fraud for income verification after a study showed 50%+ of lenders experienced document fraud

**Conversation starter:** "How many of you have caught AI-generated fake bank statements in the last 6 months? Rohan, Plaid launched anti-fraud tools for income verification — is that solving the problem or just the beginning?"

---

### TOPIC 4: CFPB Section 1071 — The Data Collection Rule That Could Reshape the Industry
**Why it is urgent:** The CFPB's small business lending data collection rule (Section 1071) has new compliance deadlines:
- **July 1, 2026:** Highest-volume lenders (2,500+ covered transactions) must comply
- **January 1, 2027:** Moderate-volume lenders (500+ transactions)
- **October 1, 2027:** Smallest-volume lenders (100+ transactions)

However, in November 2025, the CFPB proposed revisions that would raise the coverage threshold from 100 to 1,000 originations and push to a single compliance date of January 1, 2028.

**The debate:** Is this a reprieve for MCA funders, or just delaying the inevitable? A federal judge already upheld that MCAs should be regulated as credit transactions under this rule.

**Who cares most:**
- **Herk Christie** (ECG) — With $1B+ funded, ECG is likely a high-volume lender that must comply by July 2026
- **Aman Mahajan** (Biz2Credit) — $8B+ in SMB lending makes Biz2Credit clearly in scope
- **Kaustubh Joshi** (iBusiness) — SBA lending is clearly covered; the question is how LenderAI adapts to new data collection requirements
- **David Tilis** (Coral Capital) — Built compliance infrastructure at Cross River and FinWise; knows what it takes to implement these systems

**Conversation starter:** "The CFPB just proposed raising the 1071 threshold from 100 to 1,000 originations. Herk, does ECG even need to worry about this now? David, you built compliance at Cross River — what does implementation actually look like?"

---

### TOPIC 5: Embedded Finance and the Battle for SMB Distribution
**Why it is the future:** The biggest shift in MCA/SMB lending is distribution. Instead of brokers sending deals, the funding is embedded directly into platforms merchants already use (ERPs, payment processors, e-commerce marketplaces).

**The players at this table:**
- **Angel Murudumbay** (Raistone) — VP Operations at the world's largest B2B embedded finance provider ($10B+ in financing). Raistone partners with SAP, NetSuite, Coupa, and Mastercard to embed financing into ERP workflows
- **Aakanksha Jadhav** (Mastercard) — Mastercard is a Raistone partner and building its own embedded SME products
- **Kaustubh Joshi** (iBusiness) — Built Goldman Sachs' embedded SMB financing with Amazon (lines of credit up to $1M for Amazon merchants). Now running LenderAI at iBusiness
- **David Tilis** (Coral Capital) — Built 30+ fintech partnerships at FinWise that originated $10B+ in loans; understands bank-fintech partnership models
- **Brian Mullins** (Vox Funding) — SYNQ API is Vox's play for embedded deal submission (just partnered with Cloudsquare for Salesforce integration)

**Conversation starter:** "Angel, Raistone just crossed $10B in embedded financing. Kos, you built the Amazon-Goldman lending program. Is the broker model dying, or does embedded finance just add another distribution layer?"

---

## 2. CROSS-ATTENDEE CONNECTIONS MAP

### Direct Professional Connections

| Connection | People | Nature |
|---|---|---|
| **Goldman Sachs Alumni** | **Kaustubh (Kos) Joshi** + **Aman Mahajan** | Both are ex-Goldman Sachs. Kos was Head of Product for Embedded Business Financing (built the Amazon partnership). Aman was in risk at Goldman before moving to Biz2Credit. They almost certainly know each other. |
| **Citibank Alumni** | **Herk Christie** + **Aman Mahajan** | Both worked at Citibank. Herk went on to Capital One then ECG. Aman went to Goldman then Biz2Credit. |
| **Mastercard-Raistone Partnership** | **Aakanksha Jadhav** + **Angel Murudumbay** | Raistone and Mastercard have a formal partnership (since 2022) on virtual card payments for accelerating working capital. They were finalists for "Best Fintech Partnership" at Finovate Awards. Aakanksha works on SME products; Angel runs operations that include the Mastercard integration. |
| **Yellowstone Capital** | **Adam Madar** (former Funding Advisor) | Adam previously worked at Yellowstone Capital before founding AMM Capital and joining Aspire Funding. The $1B judgment against Yellowstone is the biggest story in MCA. Handle with care — he likely has strong opinions. |
| **deBanked Community** | **Herk Christie, Jay Avigdor, David Tilis, Brian Mullins** | All have been featured in deBanked coverage. ECG's $1B milestone, Jay's origin story, David's appointment at Coral Capital, and Vox's SYNQ/Cloudsquare partnership were all covered by deBanked. |

### Competitive Dynamics

| Group | Companies | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **MCA Funders (Direct Competitors)** | Vox Funding, Velocity Capital, Expansion Capital, Smarter Merchant, Aspire Funding | These 5 are all MCA funders competing for the same merchant deals through ISOs and brokers. They watch each other's pricing and stacking positions closely. |
| **Revenue-Based / Factoring (Adjacent)** | Fundfi (revenue-based), Coral Capital (factoring) | Adjacent to MCA but slightly different structures. Less direct competition, more potential partnership. |
| **Platform / Tech Providers** | Plaid, Mastercard, Raistone, iBusiness, Biz2Credit | These are potential vendors TO the funders, not competitors with them. Plaid provides bank data; Mastercard provides payment infrastructure; Raistone provides embedded finance; iBusiness/Biz2Credit provide lending platforms. |

### Potential Vendor-Client Relationships

| Vendor | Potential Clients at Table | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Plaid** (Rohan) | Vox, Velocity, ECG, Smarter Merchant, Aspire, Fundfi | All MCA funders need bank account connectivity for underwriting. Plaid's API is widely used in MCA for real-time cash flow analysis. ECG specifically touts "technology-enabled" underwriting. |
| **Mastercard** (Aakanksha) | Raistone (confirmed partner), potentially all funders | Mastercard's SME credit risk models could benefit any funder at the table. Virtual card integration with Raistone is live. |
| **LenderAI / iBusiness** (Kos) | Primarily SBA lenders, but could extend to MCA platforms | LenderAI processes 1,200+ applications daily. Recently signed SBA WORX ($7B in SBA loans). Could pivot to serve MCA funders. |
| **Biz2X** (Aman) | Banks and lenders who want AI underwriting | Biz2X is a platform-as-a-service for lenders. Any funder at the table could be a potential client for the AI Underwriting Agent. |

### Conference & Industry Overlap

| Event | Likely Attendees |
|---|---|
| **deBanked CONNECT Miami 2026** (Feb 12) | Likely all 12 — this dinner is presumably tied to this event |
| **Broker Fair NYC** (annual, May) | Jay Avigdor, Adam Madar (confirmed 2025), Brian Mullins, Herk Christie, Nabil Aziz |
| **Funders Forum + Broker Expo** (March 2026, Hollywood FL) | MCA funders will likely attend — Vox, Velocity, ECG, Smarter Merchant, Aspire, Fundfi |
| **LendIt / Fintech Nexus** | Plaid, Mastercard, Biz2Credit, iBusiness — the platform/tech players |
| **IFA Conference** | David Tilis (Coral Capital is IFA-covered), Gerard Lucero (factoring background) |

**Icebreakers:**
- "Jay, you've talked about your AI achieving 93% default accuracy. What data signals are driving that — is it mostly deposit patterns, or are you using alternative data like demographics?"
- "You started Velocity from your house in 2018 and built it to $850M in sales. What did the first year look like vs. now?"
- "With Colorado's AI disclosure law just taking effect in February 2026, does your AI underwriting model need to change how it explains decisions?"

---

**Background:** Senior Underwriter at Fundfi Merchant Funding (revenue-based financing). Previous experience at Liquid Capital (factoring) and FundThrough (invoice financing). Fundfi recently expanded its senior credit facility to accelerate growth.

**Icebreakers:**
- "Gerard, you've done factoring at Liquid Capital, invoice financing at FundThrough, and now revenue-based at Fundfi. How does underwriting differ across those three models?"
- "Fundfi expanded its credit facility recently. Is the growth coming from new merchant verticals or deeper penetration in existing ones?"
- "As an underwriter, what's the first thing you look at when a merchant application comes in — bank statements, processing volume, or something else?"

---

### 7. Angel Murudumbay — VP Operations, Raistone
**Background:** VP Operations at Raistone, the world's largest B2B embedded finance provider ($10B+ in financing, 6 years of 2x YoY growth). Partners include SAP, NetSuite, Coupa, Mastercard. Previously at TIAA Bank, State Street, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Rose from Associate to VP internally at Raistone.

**Icebreakers:**
- "Angel, Raistone crossed $10B in 5 years with a purely embedded model. What does operations look like at that scale — are you mostly managing tech integrations or capital deployment?"
- "The Mastercard partnership enables virtual card payments for accelerating working capital. How has adoption been with SMBs?"

Then led embedded finance at Funding Circle. Now running LenderAI, which processes $7B+ in SBA loans and 1,200+ applications daily.

**Icebreakers:**
- "Kos, you built the Goldman-Amazon lending program. What was the biggest lesson about embedded distribution that you're applying at iBusiness now?"
- "LenderAI just signed SBA WORX and Business Loan Capital. What's the pitch to lenders who are still using legacy loan origination systems?"
- "Goldman to Funding Circle to iBusiness — each one a different model. What do they all have in common about what makes SMB lending work?"

---

### 9. Aman Mahajan — CRO, Biz2Credit
**Background:** Chief Risk Officer at Biz2Credit ($8B+ in SMB lending). Previously at Goldman Sachs and Citibank. Biz2X launched AI Underwriting Agent (30-40% faster approvals), AI CRM, and partnered with Columbia University on AI for SMB lending. Biz2X processes for banks, credit unions, and non-bank lenders.

**Icebreakers:**
- "Aman, the Biz2X AI Underwriting Agent claims 30-40% faster approvals. What were the hardest parts to automate — document ingestion, risk decisioning, or compliance checks?"
- "You've done risk at Goldman, Citi, and now Biz2Credit. How does risk management for a $8B SMB lending platform differ from risk at a bulge bracket bank?"
- "The Columbia University partnership is ambitious — using AI to unlock $750B in small business financing. What's the research focused on?"

---

### 10. David Tilis — CSO, Coral Capital Solutions

---

### Person-by-Person Angles

#### 1. Brian Mullins (Vox Funding) — **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Angle: API-native integration with SYNQ**
- Brian just built SYNQ API and partnered with Cloudsquare. He thinks in APIs and integrations.
- **Pitch:** "Brian, with SYNQ you've built the deal submission pipeline. The next bottleneck is what happens after submission — bank statement analysis, document verification, identity checks. HyperVerge's APIs can plug directly into SYNQ to automate the intake-to-decision pipeline. Under 5 seconds per document, 80%+ straight-through processing."
- **Pain point:** Vox receives applications via SYNQ but still needs manual review of bank statements and documents. HyperVerge eliminates that step.

#### 2. Herk Christie (ECG) — **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Angle: Scaling the 45-minute decision to under 10 minutes**
- ECG decisions 90% of leads in 45 minutes. That's good for the industry but slow for a tech-enabled lender.
- **Pitch:** "Herk, ECG's 45-minute turnaround is industry-leading, but imagine if the bank statement analysis and document verification happened in 5 seconds instead of 20 minutes. HyperVerge's bank statement analysis API can parse, reconcile, and flag anomalies — even from scanned PDFs — and feed structured data directly into your decisioning engine."
- **Pain point:** ECG's speed comes from process, not fully from automation. HyperVerge can be the automation layer.
- **Bonus:** Herk comes from Capital One and Citi, where vendor procurement is structured. He will understand enterprise integration pitches.

#### 3. Rohan Sriram (Plaid) — **PARTNERSHIP ANGLE**
**Angle: Complementary, not competitive — Plaid does connectivity, HyperVerge does document intelligence**
- Plaid connects to bank accounts via API. HyperVerge analyzes bank statement documents (PDFs, images, scans). Many MCA funders receive physical/PDF bank statements from brokers — Plaid can't help there.
- **Pitch:** "Rohan, Plaid is the gold standard for account connectivity, but a huge chunk of MCA underwriting still runs on uploaded bank statement PDFs and scanned documents. HyperVerge handles the document layer — fraud detection on uploaded statements, OCR from messy scans, tampering detection. We're complementary: Plaid for live data, HyperVerge for document verification."
- **Potential:** Explore partnership where Plaid recommends HyperVerge for document-based workflows, or co-sell into the same funders.

#### 4. Nabil Aziz (Smarter Merchant) — **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Angle: AI-powered fraud detection for the risk team**
- Nabil is Head of Risk. His job is catching bad applications. This is HyperVerge's core value proposition.
- **Pitch:** "Nabil, you're seeing AI-generated fake bank statements that are getting harder to catch. HyperVerge's document fraud detection was built for exactly this — we detect tampered documents, check for inconsistent fonts, mismatched formatting, manipulated transaction histories. We've verified over a billion identities. Can we show you what we catch that manual review misses?"
- **Pain point:** Fraudsters can buy bank statement templates for $10 and customize them with GenAI. Nabil's team is fighting an asymmetric war — HyperVerge levels the playing field.

#### 5. Jay Avigdor (Velocity Capital) — **MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY**
**Angle: Feed clean, verified data into his AI underwriting model**
- Jay is building in-house AI for underwriting. AI is only as good as the data going in.
- **Pitch:** "Jay, your AI is predicting defaults at 93% accuracy, but that model is only as good as the data going in. If a fraudulent bank statement gets past intake and into your training data, it corrupts the model. HyperVerge sits at the front of the pipeline — we verify that bank statements are authentic before your AI ever sees them. Clean data in, better predictions out."
- **Pain point:** Garbage in, garbage out. His 93% accuracy claim becomes meaningless if synthetic documents poison his training data.

#### 6. Gerard Lucero (Fundfi) — **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Angle: Revenue verification for revenue-based financing**
- Fundfi's model depends on accurate revenue data. If revenue documents are fabricated, the entire funding model breaks.
- **Pitch:** "Gerard, revenue-based financing is directly tied to how accurately you can verify a merchant's actual revenue. HyperVerge can extract revenue trends from bank statements, invoices, and sales reports — and flag inconsistencies that suggest inflation or fabrication. We also auto-classify industries from transaction patterns, which feeds into your risk pricing."
- **Pain point:** Revenue-based financing has the same document fraud problem as MCA, but the stakes are different — bad revenue data means the repayment schedule is wrong from day one.

#### 7. Angel Murudumbay (Raistone) — **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Angle: KYB (Know Your Business) for embedded finance onboarding**
- Raistone embeds financing into ERP platforms. Every new business being onboarded needs to be verified.
- **Pitch:** "Angel, when Raistone embeds financing into SAP or NetSuite, every business going through that pipeline needs identity verification and business verification. HyperVerge handles KYB — company record verification, document extraction, identity checks — all via API that can be embedded directly into the onboarding flow."
- **Pain point:** Embedded finance means high volume, low touch. Manual verification doesn't scale. HyperVerge's API-first approach fits the embedded model.

#### 8. Kaustubh (Kos) Joshi (iBusiness) — **HIGH PRIORITY (PARTNERSHIP)**
**Angle: HyperVerge as document intelligence layer inside LenderAI**
- LenderAI processes 1,200+ applications daily. That's a massive document intake pipeline.
- **Pitch:** "Kos, LenderAI handles 1,200 applications a day. Every one of those comes with bank statements, tax returns, corporate documents. HyperVerge can be the document intelligence layer inside LenderAI — extracting, verifying, and flagging in under 5 seconds per document. We do 80%+ straight-through processing, meaning your human underwriters only see the exceptions."
- **Pain point:** At 1,200 applications/day, even a small percentage of manual document review creates a bottleneck. SBA loans have heavy documentation requirements — HyperVerge automates that.
- **Bonus:** Kos comes from Goldman and understands enterprise platform deals. He might be open to a technology partnership.

#### 9. Aman Mahajan (Biz2Credit) — **HIGH PRIORITY (PARTNERSHIP)**
**Angle: Competing document analysis layer or partnership opportunity**
- Biz2X already has AI-powered document parsing. HyperVerge may be competitive or complementary.
- **Pitch approach:** "Aman, Biz2X has impressive AI underwriting capabilities. Where does your document parsing come from — is it built in-house? HyperVerge specializes in the document layer — bank statement fraud detection, OCR from scanned documents, identity verification. If Biz2X is looking for a best-in-class document intelligence partner, that's our sweet spot."
- **Caution:** Biz2X may have built similar capabilities internally. Research their document processing before this conversation. This could be competitive.
- **Alternative angle:** Focus on fraud detection specifically — even if they have good OCR, do they have tamper detection? HyperVerge's fraud detection (inconsistent fonts, formatting anomalies, AI-generated document detection) may be additive.

#### 10. David Tilis (Coral Capital) — **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Angle: Document verification for factoring and ABL**
- Factoring requires invoice verification. ABL requires asset verification. Both involve heavy documentation.
- **Pitch:** "David, factoring depends on invoice authenticity. ABL depends on accurate asset documentation. HyperVerge extracts and verifies invoices, purchase orders, and financial documents — flagging fraud, inconsistencies, and duplicates. Given your experience building fintech partnerships at Cross River and FinWise, you know the value of plug-in verification layers."
- **Bonus angle:** David built 30+ fintech partnerships. He may be a connector to other lenders and platforms in his network, even if Coral Capital isn't the primary buyer.

#### 11. Aakanksha Jadhav (Mastercard) — **STRATEGIC / LONG-TERM**
**Angle: Complementary data for GenAI credit models**
- Mastercard sees transaction data. HyperVerge sees document data. Together, they create a more complete picture.
- **Pitch:** "Aakanksha, your GenAI credit models use Mastercard transaction data. But SMEs applying for credit also submit bank statements, tax returns, and business documents. HyperVerge extracts structured data from those documents — cash flow patterns, revenue trends, industry classification. That document-layer data could complement Mastercard's transaction data to improve model accuracy."
- **Long-term play:** This is not a quick sale. It's a relationship-building conversation. Mastercard moves slowly but at massive scale.
- **Bonus:** Both are building AI for credit risk. Share perspectives on model explainability (given the regulatory pressure from Colorado SB 24-205 and CFPB guidance).

#### 12. Adam Madar (Aspire Funding) — **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Angle: Post-Yellowstone, compliance-forward underwriting**
- Aspire Funding needs to demonstrate rigorous, defensible underwriting — especially given Adam's Yellowstone background.
- **Pitch:** "Adam, in a post-Yellowstone world, every MCA funder needs to show regulators that their underwriting is thorough and documented. HyperVerge provides an automated audit trail — every bank statement analyzed, every document verified, every identity checked, all with timestamps and confidence scores. If an AG comes knocking, you have a complete, defensible paper trail."
- **Pain point:** Yellowstone's downfall was partly about documentation — contracts that didn't reflect reality. HyperVerge ensures the intake documents are authentic and the verification process is auditable.

## APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE CARD

### Seating Strategy Suggestion
If you can influence seating, try to be near:
1. **Kos Joshi** (iBusiness) — Highest partnership potential. LenderAI processes 1,200+ applications/day. Enterprise buyer.
2. **Herk Christie** (ECG) — Large funder ($1.2B+), tech-enabled, enterprise procurement mindset from Capital One/Citi background.
3. **Brian Mullins** (Vox) — CTO, API thinker, just built SYNQ. Most likely to understand and champion a technical integration.

### Key Stats to Drop Casually
- "We've verified over a billion identities globally"
- "Under 5 seconds per document, 80%+ straight-through processing"
- "Bank statement fraud is up 30% year-over-year — we detect tampered documents that look perfect to human reviewers"
- "We work with lenders across 195 countries"

### Do NOT Lead With
- Generic identity verification pitch (everyone thinks they've solved KYC)
- Compliance scare tactics (regulators are the enemy at this table, not the motivation)
- India-centric examples (this is a US MCA audience; use US-relevant use cases)

### DO Lead With
- Document fraud detection (every funder at the table has been burned by fake bank statements)
- Speed-to-decision (MCA is a speed game — whoever funds first gets the deal)
- API integration (this audience builds and buys tech; they want plug-and-play)
- Audit trail / defensibility (post-Yellowstone, everyone is thinking about AG investigations)
