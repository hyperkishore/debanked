## TALKING POINTS BY COMPANY

---

### TIER 1: SQOs (Must-Meet)

#### BITTY -- Daniel Dames, VP of Ops
**What they do:** Small business funder, MCA provider. Daniel is speaking on the Funder Panel.
**Talking points:**
- "How are you handling underwriting volume as you scale? We're seeing funders your size hitting a wall at 40 min per deal manually."
- "We cut that to under 5 minutes -- application intake, cash flow analysis, CLEAR report review, all automated with explainable decisions."
- "We're already working with PIRS Capital in this space. Happy to share what we've seen work."
- **Ask:** "Would it be worth a 20-minute demo next week to show you the platform?"

#### BRITECAP FINANCIAL -- Jim Noel, VP Strategic Partnerships
**What they do:** ISO/broker firm, just launched BriteLine (on-demand capital product). Closed $150M credit facility. Jim previously at CAN Capital.
**Talking points:**
- "Congrats on the $150M facility and BriteLine launch. An on-demand capital product needs near-instant underwriting -- how are you handling that?"
- "With your broker network sending in deals, consistency is key. Our AI ensures every application gets the same rigorous, fast review regardless of source."
- "Jim, with your CAN Capital background, you've seen what happens when underwriting can't keep up with capital availability. We solve that."
- **Ask:** "With BriteLine scaling, would it make sense to explore how AI underwriting could support that growth?"

#### PIRS CAPITAL -- (Your Partner)
**What they do:** Alternative funder, eCommerce/Amazon seller focus, uses PIRScore model. Already partnered with HyperVerge.
**Talking points:**
- Touch base on joint messaging for the event
- Ask for a specific success metric or quote you can use in other conversations today
- Discuss any new opportunities in their eCommerce vertical
- Align on referral introductions at the event

#### WING LAKE CAPITAL PARTNERS -- Angelina Fletcher, Natasha Nemcek, Sara Hoski
**What they do:** Specialize in MCA debt consolidation (Franklin Fund) + growth capital (Capstone Fund). ~16 employees. Farmington Hills, MI.
**Talking points:**
- "Debt consolidation underwriting is uniquely complex -- analyzing a merchant's existing MCA stack with multiple advances and factor rates. Our AI parses bank statements and automatically identifies all MCA repayments."
- "With two funds needing different risk models, you need configurable underwriting workflows. That's exactly what we do."
- "For a 16-person team, going from 40 min to 5 min per deal is transformative. That's like adding 5 more underwriters without the headcount."
- **Ask:** "Would you be open to a quick call next week to explore how this could work for your consolidation underwriting?"

---

### TIER 2: EXISTING CLIENTS (Upsell + Get Testimonials)

#### FUNDFI -- Brian Kandinov (CEO), Natasha Dillon (CFO/COO)
**What they do:** Revenue-based financing, MCAs, traditional loans, credit splits. US + Canada. Just opened Alabama office, expanded credit facility twice in 2025.
**Talking points:**
- "Congrats on the Alabama expansion and the new product launches! How is the traditional loan product's underwriting workflow different from MCA?"
- "With the credit facility doubling, are you feeling the underwriting throughput pressure?"
- Upsell: "We can configure product-specific workflows for your new traditional loan and credit splits products."
- **Ask for testimonial:** "Would you be willing to be a reference for us? Even a quick quote about the impact would be huge."

#### FUNDKITE -- Alex Shvarts, CEO
**What they do:** Leading fintech MCA funder. $70M revenue, 91 employees, $900M+ total funding. Alex built their proprietary tech. Launched Merchant Services division.
**Talking points:**
- Talk tech-to-tech -- Alex is CTO/Founder. Discuss architecture, API integration, ML model accuracy.
- "We're not here to replace your proprietary stack -- we complement it. Bank statement OCR, CLEAR report parsing, stips verification -- the extraction work that feeds your scoring algorithms."
- "With the new Merchant Services division, you're creating cross-analysis opportunities between payment and funding data."
- **Ask for testimonial:** "Alex, given your tech credibility in the space, a mention from FundKite carries weight. Would you be open to that?"

### TIER 3: HIGH-VALUE ICPs

#### VOX FUNDING -- Louis Calderone, CEO (Funder Panel)
**What they do:** NYC MCA funder (2018). Just closed $150M credit facility with Raven Capital. 11-50 employees.
**Key angle:** "$150M in new capital with a small team. The bottleneck is now underwriting, not capital. AI isn't a luxury -- it's a necessity to deploy that capital profitably."
**Ask:** "With the new facility, how many more deals per day do you need to underwrite?"

#### VELOCITY CAPITAL GROUP -- Jay Avigdor, CEO (Dinner Roundtable)
**What they do:** Same-day MCA funding up to $1M. $50M facility. 40K+ broker relationships. Career $850M in sales.
**Dinner conversation opener:** "How do you maintain same-day funding at scale? As your broker network generates more deal flow, what's the biggest bottleneck?"
**Key angle:** Frame in terms of cost-per-funded-deal. He knows the economics cold.

#### CAN CAPITAL -- Mark Cisco (VP BD), Chris Holland (Dir Partner BD)
**What they do:** Pioneer of MCA industry (1998). $6B+ total capital deployed. Legacy systems.
**Key angle:** "With $6B in historical data and a 25+ year track record, HyperVerge's AI can overlay on your existing systems without rip-and-replace. We help reduce underwriting time on deals you'd ultimately decline."
**Ask:** "Are your legacy systems keeping up with the speed your broker partners expect?"

#### RAPID FINANCE -- Mark Cerminaro, CRO (16 years at company)
**What they do:** Full-service lender. $4.5B+ total financing. 200+ employees. MCAs, term loans, LOC, SBA loans.
**Key angle:** "Multi-product underwriting is our sweet spot. MCA, term loans, LOC, SBA -- each needs different analysis. One platform, configurable for every product."
**ROI math:** "If you have 30-50 underwriters each saving 35 min per deal, that's massive capacity gain."

#### FORWARD FINANCING -- Jill Capadanno, Sr Manager New Sales
**What they do:** Boston fintech. $4.1B+ total funding. $450M credit facility. Already uses TensorFlow/DataRobot.
**Key angle:** Don't lead with "we'll automate your underwriting" -- they already have ML. Position around document intake, stips collection, contract generation. "We handle the upstream data extraction that feeds your models."
**Jill's perspective:** She cares about speed-to-offer for her sales team. "Your sales team closes faster when applications move through underwriting faster."

#### DEXLY FINANCE -- Burkay Kaplan, CEO
**What they do:** Direct capital provider, ISO-first positioning. CEO is Harvard Business School, angel investor (70+ investments).
**Key angle:** Present as an investment in operational efficiency. "ISOs send deals to the funder that responds fastest. We make you that funder."
**Ask:** "As an investor yourself, what ROI metrics would matter most for a technology investment like this?"

#### ASPIRE FUNDING PLATFORM -- Daniel Lenefsky, CEO
**What they do:** MCA funder already using API/OCR technology + veteran underwriters. Same-day/24-hr funding. Up to 17-point ISO commissions.
**Key angle:** "You've already bought into automation with API/OCR. We're the next evolution -- not just extraction but AI-powered analysis and decisioning assistance."
**Ask:** "Your veteran underwriters are expensive and scarce. What if junior underwriters could perform at veteran levels?"

#### SIMPLY FUNDING -- Jacob Kleinberger, Head of Ops
**What they do:** Direct MCA funder, 28 employees. Doubled funding volume in consecutive years. ISO-only model.
**Key angle:** "Doubling volume with 28 people is impressive but unsustainable without automation. The next doubling either requires 56 employees or AI."
**Security angle:** Jacob is obsessive about data security -- mention SOC 2 compliance and enterprise-grade data handling.

#### MONETAFI -- Steve Kahmi, Exec Dir Strategic Partnerships
**What they do:** Brand new MCA funder (launched May 2025). Same-day funding, approvals up to $2M. White-label platform.
**Key angle:** "You don't have legacy systems to replace. Build AI-first from day one. Every other funder on this floor is retrofitting -- you can lead with it."
**White-label opportunity:** "HyperVerge's AI can be embedded as a differentiating feature for your white-label clients."
