# Sales Playbooks & Patterns

## Outreach Templates That Work
1. **News Hook** — Reference recent funding round, leadership change, or product launch
2. **Volume Pain** — "Processing X apps/month manually? Here's what 450+ MCA companies found..."
3. **Compliance Angle** — "New state regulations require faster verification..."
4. **Competitive Switch** — "Migrating from [competitor]? Here's what changed..."

## Objection Responses

### "We already have a solution"
→ "Great — most of our 450+ clients started the same way. The question is whether you're getting [specific metric they care about]. Would a 15-min benchmark comparison be useful?"

### "Too expensive"
→ "What does a single bad deal cost you? Our clients typically see ROI in the first month from reduced fraud alone."

### "We're too small"
→ "Some of our fastest-growing clients started at your size. The platform scales with you — no minimum volume."

### "Not a priority right now"
→ "Totally understand. When it does become a priority, having a baseline will help you move fast. Can I send a quick analysis of your current process?"
