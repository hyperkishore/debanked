# Sales Pipeline

## P0 / SQO Accounts (Active Deal Flow)
- **Bitty Advance** — Priority 1. Strategic account.
- **BriteCap Financial** — Priority 1. Active conversations.
- **PIRS Capital** — Priority 1. Engaged prospect.
- **Wing Lake Capital** — Priority 1. In pipeline.

## P1 / ICP Accounts (Top Targets)
~200 companies matching ideal customer profile. Key segments:
- Large MCA funders processing 500+ apps/month → underwriting automation value prop
- Growing funders expanding into new products (SBA, equipment) → multi-product platform
- Tech-forward funders already using automation → upgrade/replace pitch

## Pipeline Stages
1. Researched → 2. Contacted → 3. Engaged → 4. Demo → 5. Proposal → 6. Won/Lost

## Current Focus
- Move P0 accounts from engaged → demo
- Start outreach to top 20 P1 accounts with highest outreach scores
