Since Hecker's acquisition, Bitty has facilitated over $420M in cumulative funding to 29,000+ small businesses with products ranging from $2,000 to $250,000. In 2023, Bitty originated approximately $165M in revenue-based financing. The company generated $8.5M in adjusted net income for the trailing 12 months ending March 2024, attracting a strategic 35% equity investment from publicly traded OppFi (NYSE: OPFI) in August 2024 for $15.25M cash plus $2.7M in stock. OppFi has options to acquire majority ownership by 2027 and full ownership by 2030. In Q3 2025, Bitty generated $1.4M in equity income for OppFi alone. Bitty self-identifies as a 'tech company first' and recently launched a fixed-term installment loan product in Texas (Sept 2025) to comply with new state MCA regulations, integrated with Cloudsquare's Salesforce-based broker CRM for API submissions (Jan 2025), and was a Platinum Sponsor at the B2B Finance Expo 2025 in Las Vegas.",

Wing Lake receives approximately 800 referrals weekly from MCA companies, has funded 75+ companies totaling $100M+, and reports ~$25M in annual revenue. The firm partnered with Rocky Mountain Bank (Wyoming) in 2020, expanding its lending capabilities. Wing Lake claims a 90% success rate in helping client companies avoid bankruptcy.

(2) Document processing at scale — RBF requires bank statements, financials, tax returns, licenses for each deal; HyperVerge automates extraction/classification. (3) No AI in public messaging — website emphasizes 'personal customer service' and 'high-touch' model; no mentions of AI/ML/automation in any public materials; tech messaging is cautious. (4) CTO from trading software (Eze Software/Raytheon) and CIO from bank infrastructure (RBS) — strong infra but possibly limited exposure to modern AI document processing. (5) Growth demands automation — $5B crossed with accelerating trajectory, $100M VPC facility to deploy; need to process more deals faster without proportionally growing underwriting headcount. (6) Paradisi recruited Benjamin Armour (CMO) from City National Bank of FL — he brings people he trusts, which means approaching through his network may work. (7) SOC 2 + new CCO signals compliance maturity — HyperVerge's enterprise security posture will resonate. (8) 10-year anniversary Sept 2026 — good conversation anchor. APPROACH WITH PARADISI: Frame as 'operational efficiency at scale' not 'AI replacing underwriters'. Reference his $18B→$26B growth at CNB. He thinks in M&A/growth strategy language. Board member of Junior Achievement (financial literacy for at-risk youth) — genuine personal interest. Avoid: positioning as replacing their credit team (deep institutional pride) or leading with AI buzzwords.",
