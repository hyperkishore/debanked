Since Hecker's acquisition, Bitty has facilitated over $420M in cumulative funding to 29,000+ small businesses with products ranging from $2,000 to $250,000. In 2023, Bitty originated approximately $165M in revenue-based financing. The company generated $8.5M in adjusted net income for the trailing 12 months ending March 2024, attracting a strategic 35% equity investment from publicly traded OppFi (NYSE: OPFI) in August 2024 for $15.25M cash plus $2.7M in stock. OppFi has options to acquire majority ownership by 2027 and full ownership by 2030. In Q3 2025, Bitty generated $1.4M in equity income for OppFi alone. Bitty self-identifies as a 'tech company first' and recently launched a fixed-term installment loan product in Texas (Sept 2025) to comply with new state MCA regulations, integrated with Cloudsquare's Salesforce-based broker CRM for API submissions (Jan 2025), and was a Platinum Sponsor at the B2B Finance Expo 2025 in Las Vegas.",

Wing Lake receives approximately 800 referrals weekly from MCA companies, has funded 75+ companies totaling $100M+, and reports ~$25M in annual revenue. The firm partnered with Rocky Mountain Bank (Wyoming) in 2020, expanding its lending capabilities. Wing Lake claims a 90% success rate in helping client companies avoid bankruptcy.

New CTO Victor Tuson Palau (hired Feb 2025) means active technology investment and openness to new tools.

They position themselves as the #1 online provider of small business loans, offering fast and flexible financing that can provide working capital in as little as 48 hours. Their merchant cash advance program provides up to $500,000 with approvals within 24-48 hours. The company operates from Pennsylvania (724 area code) but maintains a low public profile — no founders, owners, or leadership team members are publicly identified on their website or in available directories.

    "notes": "SELLING ANGLES: (1) Underwriting speed bottleneck — 1,800+ deals/year with large manual credit team (5+ senior leaders), while competitors like Dragin offer AI pre-underwriting in 30 seconds vs Libertas's 'one business day' credit approval. (2) Document processing at scale — RBF requires bank statements, financials, tax returns, licenses for each deal; HyperVerge automates extraction/classification. (3) No AI in public messaging — website emphasizes 'personal customer service' and 'high-touch' model; no mentions of AI/ML/automation in any public materials; tech messaging is cautious. (4) CTO from trading software (Eze Software/Raytheon) and CIO from bank infrastructure (RBS) — strong infra but possibly limited exposure to modern AI document processing. (5) Growth demands automation — $5B crossed with accelerating trajectory, $100M VPC facility to deploy; need to process more deals faster without proportionally growing underwriting headcount. (6) Paradisi recruited Benjamin Armour (CMO) from City National Bank of FL — he brings people he trusts, which means approaching through his network may work. (7) SOC 2 + new CCO signals compliance maturity — HyperVerge's enterprise security posture will resonate. (8) 10-year anniversary Sept 2026 — good conversation anchor. APPROACH WITH PARADISI: Frame as 'operational efficiency at scale' not 'AI replacing underwriters'. Reference his $18B→$26B growth at CNB. He thinks in M&A/growth strategy language. Board member of Junior Achievement (financial literacy for at-risk youth) — genuine personal interest. Avoid: positioning as replacing their credit team (deep institutional pride) or leading with AI buzzwords.",

    "desc": "DigiFi is a cloud-based digital loan origination platform founded in 2017 by Joshua Jersey, Bradley Vanderstarren, and Matthew Norton, headquartered in Miami, FL (with a New York office at 25 Broadway). The platform automates the end-to-end loan origination process for consumer, mortgage, small business, and commercial lending. DigiFi-enabled lenders have processed more than $100 billion in loan applications. The company reached approximately $15M in annual revenue as of mid-2025 with about 50 employees across 4 continents. DigiFi's tech stack includes React, Node.js, and Lua, and the platform is SOC 2 Type II compliant. In 2025, DigiFi launched an AI Agent purpose-built to automate nuanced loan origination tasks such as conditions, stipulations, and verification activities. Key partnerships include Ascent (application optimization, Jan 2025), ValidiFI (automated credit decisioning, Dec 2024), Scienaptic AI (AI-powered credit decisions), and Carrington Labs (cash flow underwriting, Aug 2025). The founders previously built Promise Financial together and created DigiFi after being frustrated by legacy origination technology. THIS IS A HYPERVERGE COMPETITOR in the lending technology/underwriting automation space — DigiFi's AI agent and automated decisioning capabilities directly compete with HyperVerge's document analysis and underwriting products for the same lender customers.",
