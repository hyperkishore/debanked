- **Regulatory tightening**: Texas passed HB 700 (effective Sept 1, 2025) severely restricting automatic debits for sales-based financing. North Dakota expanded its "loan" definition to potentially cover MCAs (effective Aug 1, 2025). The SBA stopped allowing refinancing of MCAs.
- **AI-driven underwriting**: Companies are racing to implement AI for faster decisioning, fraud detection, and portfolio management.
- **ABS/Securitization boom**: Multiple companies completed first-ever or record securitizations in 2025, signaling institutional investor confidence.
- **Embedded lending**: Fundbox, Wayflyer, and others are pivoting toward embedding capital directly into SaaS/platform workflows.
- **Fraud as #1 threat**: Identity verification, document authenticity (OCR/bank statement analysis), and AML checks are top priorities for MCA CRMs.

**HyperVerge Relevance**: The entire industry is moving toward technology-driven underwriting. OCR for bank statement analysis, ID verification for fraud prevention, and document authenticity checks are explicitly cited as critical needs in 2025-2026 MCA compliance checklists.

## KEY INDUSTRY THEMES FOR HYPERVERGE POSITIONING

1. **ABS/Securitization Wave**: Forward Financing, Kapitus, BHG, Mulligan, and others are all completing securitizations. ABS investors require institutional-grade underwriting documentation and verification audit trails. HyperVerge should position as enabling "ABS-ready" underwriting.

2. **AI Underwriting Arms Race**: ByzFunder, Credibly, and others are building or patenting AI lending systems. These systems are only as good as their input data. HyperVerge should position OCR and verification as the "data quality layer" for AI decisioning.

3. **Regulatory Compliance Pressure**: Texas HB 700, North Dakota expansions, FTC enforcement (Biz2Credit $33M settlement). Companies need verified documentation to survive regulatory scrutiny.

4. **Embedded Lending Growth**: Fundbox, Wayflyer, Lendio, and ClickLease are all embedding lending into third-party platforms. Each new platform integration requires automated onboarding verification.

5. **Fraud Prevention Priority**: Industry sources explicitly cite identity verification and document authenticity as top priorities. MCA CRMs now integrate with TruePic, Heron Data, Plaid, Ocrolus, and DecisionLogic. HyperVerge competes/complements in this space.
